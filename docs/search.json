Somatic mutations gene expression data matched tumour-normal samples (blood SM solid tissue GE) collected Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Tomczak et al. 2015) BC, using R package TCGAbiolinks (Colaprico et al. 2015) considering human genome version 38 (hg38). Mutation Annotation Format files obtained 4 pipelines: Muse (Fan et al. 2016), Mutect2 (Cibulskis et al. 2013), SomaticSniper (Larson et al. 2011), Varscan2 (Koboldt et al. 2012). mutation sites detected least two variant callers considered. Gene mutation frequencies (\\(f\\)) calculated fraction subjects gene associated least one mutation. Gene expression data obtained using TCGA workflow ``HTSeq-Counts’’. R package limma (Ritchie et al. 2015) used normalize quantify differential expression matched tumor-normal samples, yielding log-fold changes, corresponding p-values FDRs (BH method). Adjacency matrix (\\(\\)) undirected interaction network STRING (Szklarczyk et al. 2015) used; \\(X0\\) matrix defined two column vectors: \\(x_1 = f\\) \\(x_2 = -log_{10}(FDR)\\). can load \\(X0\\) \\(\\) follows: Let’s normalize adjacency matrix \\(W\\) create 50 permutations \\(X0\\). list X0_perm 51 elements, first input matrix \\(X0\\), others permutations; can load precomputed permutations using data(X0_perm), permutations obtained seed equal 2. Now, let’s apply network diffusion list X0_perm; can load precomputed diffused scores using data(Xs): Network-diffusion, quantifies network proximity gene altered genes (positive elements \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\)), transformed input vector \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\(x_1^*\\) \\(x_2^*\\) respectively.
